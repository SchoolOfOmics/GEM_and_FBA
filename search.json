    "text": "Project Summary\nThis project involved the reanalysis of a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of dengue virus-infected human subjects. While the original study focused on immune profiling and disease severity, our objective was to revisit this dataset with a new perspective: to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of host cells induced by dengue virus infection.\nAfter downloading and curating the raw sequencing data (FASTQ format or processed matrices), we applied a standardized analysis pipeline using tools such as Cell Ranger, Seurat, and DESeq2 in R, alongside alignment and quantification tools like STAR on a Linux-based environment. Our initial steps included:\nOnce confident in cell-type identity and group classification, we shifted our focus toward host metabolic pathways. Using curated gene sets and public databases such as KEGG, Reactome, and Recon3D, we extracted metabolic gene expression profiles across different immune cell types.\nTo move beyond gene-level analysis, we employed constraint-based modeling approaches such as Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) to simulate and quantify changes in cellular metabolism. Using context-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs), we mapped transcriptomic signals to metabolic reaction constraints, allowing us to:\nOur results revealed significant rewiring of metabolic programs in specific immune cell populations, suggesting that dengue virus may exploit host metabolic plasticity to support its replication or modulate immune responses. For instance, enhanced glycolytic activity and suppressed oxidative phosphorylation were observed in certain pro-inflammatory monocyte clusters.\nThis integrative approach, combining scRNA-seq with systems biology and metabolic modeling, offers a high-resolution view of how host metabolism responds dynamically to viral infection. Such insights may guide future research into host-directed therapies targeting metabolic pathways during dengue and other viral diseases.",

    "text": "This study integrates multiple single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to investigate host responses to dengue virus (DENV) infection with a focus on immune dynamics and metabolic reprogramming. The analysis incorporates data from both controlled experimental infections and natural clinical cases, providing a comprehensive view of the human response to DENV.\n\nHuman Challenge Study (Public Dataset 1)\n\nThe first dataset originates from a controlled human challenge study, where five healthy volunteers were experimentally infected with DENV under clinical supervision. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected at six time points post-infection (e.g., days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10), enabling a detailed time-resolved analysis of the immune response as the infection progressed. This longitudinal design allows for modeling early host responses and tracking dynamic changes in cellular states and gene expression patterns.\n\nNatural Infection Cohort (Public Dataset 2)\n\nThe second public dataset includes samples from five individuals naturally infected with dengue virus in an endemic setting. These samples represent real-world, acute-phase infections and serve as an external validation for the patterns observed in the challenge study. Unlike the time-resolved design of the first dataset, this cohort provides a snapshot of the host response during peak infection.\n\nIn-House Clinical Dataset (New Data)\n\nAdditionally, we generated a new scRNA-seq dataset from a clinical study conducted at our institute. This dataset includes 10 dengue-infected patients and 10 healthy control individuals, with PBMCs collected during the acute phase of infection. This independent cohort enhances the robustness of our findings and supports cross-cohort comparison.\n\n\n\n\nExperiment plan",
