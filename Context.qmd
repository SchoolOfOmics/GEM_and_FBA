# Contextualization of GEM {.unnumbered}

The **Human-GEM** represents a comprehensive, generic model of human metabolism, encompassing metabolic reactions that are known to occur in any human cell. However, because it includes all possible reactions, it does not correspond to the metabolism of any specific tissue or cell type, where only a subset of reactions is active. To address this, a **GEM extraction** or **contextualization** process is required to generate a **context-specific** or **tissue-specific metabolic model**. This process involves integrating relevant datasets, such as transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic data into the reference metabolic network to tailor the model to a particular biological context.

Generic models such as Recon1, EHMN, and HumanCyc are valuable for representing overall human metabolism, but they are not tissue-specific and therefore cannot directly be used to study particular cell types or diseases. Early efforts in tissue-specific modeling utilized transcriptional data to derive models for several human tissues based on subsets of Recon1. Although these models provided insights into tissue-level metabolic behavior under various genetic and physiological conditions, they were limited by the approximations inherent in using transcriptomic data alone. Later approaches combined transcriptomic and proteomic data with Recon1 to develop more flexible, tissue-specific models, such as those representing liver metabolism.

The goal of computational algorithms used for tissue or cell-type specific model construction is to integrate information on the presence or absence of metabolic enzymes while maintaining a **well-connected metabolic network**. A well-connected network ensures that metabolites consumed in one reaction can be produced by another or are available from the cellular environment. However, challenges arise because transcriptomic data are often noisy, relative rather than absolute, and do not always correlate with enzyme abundance or activity.

To improve the contextualization process, Agren and colleagues developed an automated computational framework for generating cell-type-specific genome-scale metabolic networks. The central component of this framework is the **Integrative Network Inference for Tissues (INIT)** algorithm, which incorporates evidence from the **Human Protein Atlas (HPA)** regarding the presence or absence of metabolic enzymes in specific cell types. INIT also integrates tissue-specific transcriptomic data and constrains the resulting model so that it can produce metabolites experimentally identified in a given tissue, based on information from metabolomics databases such as the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).

A key feature of GEMs is the hierarchical structure of **gene–transcript–protein–reaction (GTPR)** associations. Each metabolic reaction in the model is linked to one or more enzymes, which in turn are connected to their corresponding genes and transcripts. The INIT algorithm assigns evidence-based scores to reactions based on the expression or presence of their associated genes and proteins. Using these scores, the algorithm identifies a subnetwork consisting of reactions with strong experimental support for activity in the target cell type. The extraction process seeks to maximize the total evidence score while ensuring that all reactions in the resulting network can carry flux and that metabolites detected experimentally can be synthesized from known precursors.

Although INIT provides valuable snapshots of tissue-specific metabolism, the resulting models are not directly functional for simulation-based studies. To address this limitation, a modified approach known as **task-driven Integrative Network Inference for Tissues (tINIT)** was developed. The tINIT algorithm enables the reconstruction of **functional genome-scale metabolic models** by defining specific metabolic tasks that the contextualized model must be capable of performing. It improves upon INIT by ensuring that reversible reactions cannot carry flux in both directions simultaneously and by allowing users to specify whether net production of all metabolites should be permitted. Additionally, tINIT incorporates a list of core metabolic reactions expected to occur in all cell types, ensuring that reconstructed models maintain essential metabolic functionality while accurately representing tissue-specific features.
