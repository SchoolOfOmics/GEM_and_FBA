# Practical Session {.unnumbered}

We have learned that several generic models of the human metabolic network are publicly available and can be used. In this hands-on session, we will use the latest version of Human1 (Human-GEM) [Human-GEM GitHub](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/Human-GEM).

If you want to visually inspect the curated metabolic reactions in Human-GEM, you can use the [Metabolic Atlas](https://metabolicatlas.org/). The *Map Viewer* functionality allows you to explore the network. Since the number of reactions is very large, you will need to inspect each cellular compartment separately.

Another useful resource is the table of all reactions in the model. This is available in the Human-GEM GitHub repository. Navigate to the `model` folder and download the Excel file. It contains each reaction, its equation, the genes (enzymes) catalyzing it, the corresponding metabolic pathway, etc. This file will be useful for your analysis.

### Exercise 1

Download the Human-GEM generic model from the corresponding GitHub repository, load the model into your programming environment, and inspect the number of reactions, metabolites, and genes.

```python
import cobra

GenericGEM = cobra.io.load_matlab_model("Human-GEM.mat")
GenericGEM
```

### Exercise 2

Use biomass production as the objective function, perform flux balance analysis (FBA), and inspect the flux rates computed for each reaction for maximum biomass production in the human generic GEM.

`MAR13082` is the ID for the biomass production reaction, which is included by default.

```python
GenericGEM.objective = GenericGEM.reactions.MAR13082  # Set objective function

solution = GenericGEM.optimize()  # Run optimization
solution  # Contains predicted fluxes

flux_df = solution.fluxes.to_frame()
flux_df.columns = ["Flux"]

flux_df.to_csv("fba_solution.tsv", sep="\t")
```

In the FBA output, you can see fluxes and reduced costs:

* **0** â†’ Reaction is active or could be active without changing the objective.
* **Negative** â†’ Increasing this reactionâ€™s flux would increase the objective (beneficial).
* **Positive** â†’ Increasing this reactionâ€™s flux would decrease the objective (detrimental).

ðŸ”¹ Negative reduced cost â†’ beneficial.
ðŸ”¹ Positive reduced cost â†’ detrimental.
ðŸ”¹ Zero â†’ neutral or already optimal.

### Exercise 3

Change the objective function to ATP hydrolysis and perform FBA. Compare the fluxes with the previous biomass objective.

`MAR03964` is the ID for ATP hydrolysis.

```python
GenericGEM.objective = GenericGEM.reactions.MAR03964  # Set ATP hydrolysis as objective

solutionATP = GenericGEM.optimize()  # Run optimization
solutionATP  # Predicted fluxes

flux_df = solutionATP.fluxes.to_frame()
flux_df.columns = ["Flux"]

flux_df.to_csv("fba_solutionATP.tsv", sep="\t")
```
